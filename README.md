# Song-Recognition-System-Which-Predicts-Lyrics-and-Chords

This repository contains a web application for song recognition using the Shazam API, developed with a React frontend and a Spring Boot backend. The application offers users a convenient and user-friendly interface to identify songs based on audio samples.

The React frontend provides a simple and intuitive interface for recording audio files. Users can easily capture audio using their device's microphone, and the recorded audio is then sent to the Spring Boot backend for processing.

The Spring Boot backend interacts with the Shazam API by making HTTP requests to perform song recognition. It utilizes the powerful capabilities of the Shazam API to analyze the audio input and retrieve detailed song information, including title, artist, and other metadata.

The recognized song details are seamlessly displayed in real-time on the React frontend, providing instant feedback to the user. The application employs reliable error handling mechanisms, ensuring smooth operation even in challenging scenarios.
